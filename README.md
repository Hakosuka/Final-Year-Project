# Final-Year-Project

This was my final year project at Maynooth University (formerly NUI Maynooth). This is an Android app which would use aircraft data gathered using a RTL-SDR receiver connected to a server, which would then stream that data to any connected client devices.

The app uses the Google Maps API to render the aircraft data as map markers which would move in real time. Unfortunately, at some time in February the receiver started to run into reliability issues, which necessitated the use of a .txt file featuring about three minutes' worth of aircraft data to demonstrate the app.
